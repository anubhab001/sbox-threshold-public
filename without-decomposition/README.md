# Distribution of Boolean Monomials (No Decomposition)
* [`no-decomposition.py`](./without-decomposition/no-decomposition.py): Code to generate sharing of monomials based threshold for a given SBox.

    Options/Parameters: 

    * `target_sbx` (at or near line 301, default: 3-bit SBox `03214756`): in [`sage.crypto.sbox.SBox`](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/cryptography/sage/crypto/sbox.html) format. *It is tested for up to some 5-bit SBox, though it should be able to run larger SBox.*
    * `ti_order` (at or near line 303, default: `1`) Positive integer to indicate the number of shares (which is calculated as the algebraic degree $+$ `ti_order`).
    * `logfile` (at or near line 305, default: `"wo_decomp_log.txt"` in `"a+"` mode): File used for logging.
    * `shuffle_y` (at or near line 307, default: `True`): Whether or not to shuffle the sequence of $y_{\cdot,j}$ variables when its RHS is assigned with the monomials.
    * `shuffle_rhs` (at or near line 307, default: `True`): Whether or not ordering of the collection of the monomials yet to be assigned is shuffled.
    * `uniformity_enforced` (at or near line 307, default: `False`): Whether uniformity is enforced; if `True` and fails the first time then the next iteration will internally set `shuffle_y = True`, `shuffle_rhs = True` and `shuffle_conflict_X = True`.
    * `uniformity_immediate_abort` (at or near line 307, default: `True`): To check if uniformity is satisfied for each row and abort checking immediately if one is dissatisfied, ignored if `uniformity_enforced` is set to `False`.
    * `shuffle_conflict_X` (at or near line 307, default: `False`): Whether or not to Shuffle of $x_{\cdot,j}$ varbiles which will be absent in the RHS of $y_{\cdot,j}$.

* [`uniformity-table-generator.py`](./without-decomposition/uniformity-table-generator.py): Code to generate Table 1(a) of the paper (which shows that the uniformity condition is dissatisfied for $y=x_0x_1$ with respect to the given sharing in Example 3).
* [`sample_wo_decomp_log.txt`](./without-decomposition/sample_wo_decomp_log.txt): Sample log file generated by [`no-decomposition.py`](./without-decomposition/no-decomposition.py) for the default 3-bit SBox `03214756`.
* [`default-ls.txt`](./without-decomposition/default-ls.txt): An example with DEFAULT-LS SBox (`037ED4A9CF18B265`) for threshold order 1 (the SBox being quadratic, it means that the number of shares = 3). *Each* $y_{\cdot,j}$ *variable is missing* $x_{\cdot, j}$ *for* $j=0,1,2$*; thereby satisfying the non-completeness condition.*
